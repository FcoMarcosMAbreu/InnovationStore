# Innovation Store

This side project was made to demonstrate my skills web development using JAMStack technologies.

## Tools I had used

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): The React framework for production;

- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/): React hooks for data fetching;

- [Supabase](https://supabase.io): A PostgreSQL provider for the modern web;

- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/): A awesome cloud to deliver sites to the edge.

## About my chosen stack 

Next.js is known as a fullstack framework, so there's no need to create a site project with to different repos, i.e. React as frontend and Express.js as backend. Next.js has route management based on file path. That way, we can build the frontend in `/pages/` using the React advantages and the backend in `/pages/api/` as we can do in Express.js.

Other feature of Next.js is serverless function. In combination with Cloudflare Pages, we don't need to setup a VPS or container. All we need to do is sync the site with the repo in GitHub. Each push to the repo updates the site!
